Dear editors,

Many college students have no concept of thrift in their mind. They take it for granted that they spend money from their parents before they enter into society. 

This extravagant spending is primarily caused by the following factors. First of all, nowadays most of the students are the only children of their families. They are the apple of their family's eyes and naturally get more care and pocket money. In addition, with the improvement of living standards, parents can afford higher expenditure of their children. 

From my point of view, a college student, as a pure consumer, should learn to be thrifty. We should limit our expenditure on daily necessities and not buy whatever we want regardless of their prices. The habit of thrift  can help up form right values and is favorable to our future development. 

Yours truly, 

Li Ming
