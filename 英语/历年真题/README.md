Dear Bob,

Concerning the fact that you will study and live in an esteemed university, I, as your cousin, am writing to express my heartfelt congratulations and put forward proposals about what should you do to live a worthwhile university life. 

As we all know, life in a prestigious university is perhaps not as easy as you have expected. Thus, I wish you could learn to manage life and study independently in the following four years, and gradually grow into an adult wholly responsible for yourself. 

All in all, you have no idea what a great pleasure I got when I heard the news. I am proud of you!

<p style = 'text-align:right'>Yours sincerely, <br>Zhang Wei

Sticking to the data given in the column chart above, a conclusion can be made that the dramatic changes have taken place in the Chinese auto market from 2008 to 2009. During this period there was a noticeable jump of 6% from 25% to 31% in domestic brands, while that of Japanese brands declined significantly by 10% from 35% to 25%. At the same time, the percentage of American brands remained steady at about 11% . 

The fundamental factors that contribute to the aforementioned tendency may be expounded as below. First and foremost, encountering with the very pluralistic society, many individuals, if not most, are becoming increasingly in favor of domestic brands, which renders them the economic basis for the growth of domestic automobile brands. Furthermore, all kinds of publicity, be they the newspaper or the Internet, advocate vigorously that what really matters is national self - confidence rather than worshiping foreign countries, inducing the increase of domestic brands. 

As discussed above, it is no surprise to see the current situation. What I have been reflecting on is the fact that this trend towards domestic brands is irreversible and is certain to continue in the brilliant future.

Dear Sir or Madam,

Concerning the quality of your electronic dictionary, I, as a loyal customer of your online store, am writing to express my disappointment with your products. The following are the reasons why I want to complain. 

First and foremost, the ON/OFF button is not flexible, so I have to press it with more stress than needed. Furthermore, because hosts of errors were found obviously, I no longer believe in this dictionary. Finally, but for the reputation of your online store, I could have bought one from a local mall. 

Therefore, I would like either to change to another model that works better or a full refund. Your prompt attention will be highly appreciated. 

<p style = 'text-align:right'>Yours sincerely, <br>Zhang Wei

Sticking to the data given in the table above, a conclusion can be drawn that different people have different attitude toward their jobs. The percentage of people satisfied with their jobs is highest among those over 50 years old, at about 40%. In contrast, the percentage of people dissatisfied with their jobs is highest among those between the ages of 41 to 50. 

The fundamental factors that contribute to the aforementioned situation may be expounded as below. First and foremost, encountering with the pluralistic society, many young people, if not most, are becoming increasingly unclear about what they really want to do. They want to make huge success but don't know how to make it. However, their attitudes are changing with age. The change can be bound up with the turning of folks' outlook and perspectives on success. Translated, the fact that earning money is no longer as essential as it used to be demonstrates what  really counts is be steady and enjoy life. 

As discussed above, it is no surprise to see the result. What I have reflecting on is the fact that young people should be more patient and do their best to learn skills to improve themselves.
