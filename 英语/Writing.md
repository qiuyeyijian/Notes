Dear Sir or Madam,

Moved by the noble cause of Project Hope and encouraged by what has been achieved so far, I would like to contribute my bit to the project by offering financial aid to a child in a remote area of your province. 

I would be very grateful if you could help me seek out a girl who has started schooling but whose family cannot afford her secondary education. My plan is to pay for her tuition on an annual basis until she finishes her secondary education. I would like to remit my donation directly to a bank account opened by her family in her local area.

Dear Bob,

I have just arrived at my home from the airport. As I sit down at my desk, I just want to write a letter to you to thank you for your warm reception in the cultural exchange program. You and your family left a deep impression upon me. Indeed, the program is one of the most wonderful memories in my life. 

I remember you mentioned wanting to travel in China. Well, if you come to China, you will be warmly welcomed, and it will be my pleasure to be your guide here. If you would like, send me a list beforehand of the places you would like to visit. 

Please give my best regards to your family.

### 四、2011（一）

Dear Michael, 

As one of your closest friends, I'm writing the letter in order to recommend one of my favorite movies to you-Around the World in Eighty Days. 

The primary factors for my recommendation are as follows. For one thing, this is a science fiction movie which tells us an exciting story about an English gentleman, Mr. Phileas Fogg, who makes a bet with his clubmates and managers that he can travel around the world in eighty days. For another, it gives us a vivid description of the many difficulties and incidents which happen on his journey. 

Hope you watch and enjoy the movie. Looking forward to your reply. 

<p style = 'text-align:right'>Yours,<br>Li Ming</p>



### 五、2012（一）

Dear friends, 

On behalf of the Students' Union of Beijing Foreign Studies University, I would like to extend our heartfelt welcome to all the overseas students who will study in our university. 

It is my great pleasure to offer you several practical suggestions. In the first place, life in this prestigious university is perhaps not as easy as you have expected. You may be tightly bound by daily classes, abundant homework and frequent exams. Thus, be prepared for the hectic life here. In the second place, in spite of all those burdens, various extracurricular activities such as sports meets, speech contests and social gatherings will still provide ample opportunities to make friends. So, enjoy your life in this esteemed institute! 

All in all, although there is a lot of pressure, the time you spend on our campus will be worthwhile and enhance your whole life. Hope you like here! 

<p style = 'text-align:right'>Yours sincerely, <br>Li Ming</p>



### 六、2012（二）

Dear Sir or Madam, 

I bought an electronic dictionary from your online store on January 1st, but after using it for a short period of time, I found it has some problems. 

To begin with, the battery needs recharging after a mere 2 hours of use. This means that I need to carry my charger with me when I go out for a day. In addition, the buttons on the electronic dictionary are so small that it is nearly impossible to type anything with them. Personally, I find this to be completely unacceptable. 

Therefore, I would like either to change for another model that works better or a full refund. Your help is greatly appreciated. 

<p style = 'text-align:right'>Yours sincerely, <br>Zhang Wei</p>



### 七、2013（一）

### 八、2017（二）

Dear Prof. Williams, 

I am extremely honored to accept your invitation to give a presentation to a host of foreign students on Chinese culture. 

Here are the key points of my presentation. First of all, compared with Westerners, the Chinese people have traditionally paid more attention to the harmonious relationship between human beings and nature. "Nature and Man are one" is a familiar statement in traditional Chinese ideology In addition, in Chinese thought, much emphasis is laid upon moral cultivation, the refinement of temper, and the spiritual enlightenment on the part of individual rather than upon logical reasoning. 

My appreciation to you for your invitation is beyond words. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon. 

<p style = 'text-align:right'>Yours sincerely, <br>Li Ming</p>

### 九、2018（二）

Dear Professor Smith, 

I am looking forward to my traveling to the United States and visiting you in Harvard University. 

Unfortunately, I have recently been diagnosed with a serious ear infection which will require surgery on the same day as my departure. I am sorry to say that I will therefore not be able to make the travel plan. If possible, I would like to postpone the travel plan to another day later in this year. I promise that such a situation dose not usually happen, and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. 

Please excuse me for not being able to inform you of you of my situation sooner. Your prompt attention to my suggestion would be highly appreciated. 

<p style = 'text-align:right'>Yours sincerely, <br>Li Ming</p>



### 十、2019（二）

Dear Professor Smith, 

It is my great pleasure to plan a debate on the theme of city traffic. My suggested topic is : "Private Cars—A Blessing or a curse?"

The primary reasons for my suggestion are as follows. On the one hand, some claim that there are many advantages in possessing a car. It gives a much greater degree of comfort and mobility. On the other hand, others strongly object to owing private cars. They maintain that private cars contribute to traffic congestion so greatly that the advantage gained in comfort and freedom are often cancelled out by the frustration caused by traffic jams. 

The debate has been arranged for December 22 in the Students' Recreational Center. I am looking forward to your reply.

### 一、2010（二）

From the information given in the above column chart, we can see a striking contrast between developing and developed countries in mobile-phone subscriptions from 2000 to 2008. During this period, there has been a dramatic increase from 0.4 to 4 billion mobile phone subscriptions in developing countries, while that of developed countries remained steady at just under 1 billion. 

At least two fundamental factors could have contributed to this phenomenon. On the one hand, with the rapid increase in economic development happening in developing countries, the telecommunication industry in those countries expanded greatly to meet the demand of globalization. As a result, the user base of mobile phones which can narrow the distance between people and link the whole world together, grew at an incredible speed. On the other hand, the extremely advanced civilization of developed countries means less potential in many aspects including in the area of private telecommunication tools and their demand for further enlargement of such tools tends to saturate. 

In conclusion, while mobile-phone subscription, if used carelessly or without restraint, could prove to be a double-edged sword, the fact remains that such phones are already extremely prevalent in both developing and developed countries, and even today continue to rise in popularity. If people could imbue themselves with intelligence, prudence and discretion, I am sure that most of them would be able to sidestep the potential drawbacks of mobile phones while taking advantage of all the merits. 



### 二、2012（二）

The table clearly reflects the statistics of staff's job satisfaction in a certain company. According to the data given above, we can conclude that the percentage of people satisfied with their jobs is highest among those over 50 years old, at about 40%. In contrast, the percentage of the staff not satisfied with their jobs is about 64% among those in their forties, the highest among all the three age groups. 

The major determinant of satisfaction lies in people's attitudes. On the one hand, staff members in their forties usually have to undertake a lot of responsibilities from both their families and their careers. Sometimes they are even under pressure to pursue money, power, high social status, and so on, which are all symbols of success. So, they have the least satisfaction in their jobs. On the other hand, people over 50 generally have shifted their life goals from achieving the ultimate success to a relatively easy and comfortable life, and therefore are inclined to be much more satisfied with their jobs. 

In view of the above reasoning, I am convinced that it is difficult for everyone to be content with their jobs. And it is advisable that people should adjust their expectations for word, and that companies should pay more attention to the welfare of their staff. 





### 三、2016（二）

This pie chart clearly illustrates the purpose of touring for students in a certain university. As is reflected by the diagram, 37 percent of college students travel in order to appreciate the scenery. Next comes the aim of relieving pressure, accounting for 33 percent. By contrast, the percentages of students travelling aiming at other goals, making friends and cultivating independence account for 15%, 9% and 6% respectively. 

Several primary factors could contribute to this phenomenon. In the first place, travel can offer us a wide range of experiences. In travelling, we may join tourists marveling at the incredible power of Niagara Falls, mingle with the happy throngs strolling in the Paris boulevards and experience the bitterness and joy of people on different lands and in different times. In the second place, college students, who have to juggle academic work, romantic relationships and a busy social calendar, are particularly susceptible to pressure. By touring, they can successfully manage and reduce stress. 

Taking all these factors into consideration, we may predict that with the quickening pace and ever-increasing pressure of campus life, the number of university students touring will keep growing in the forthcoming decade. 



### 四、2018（二）

The pie chart above clearly reveals the factors of consumers' concern on choosing restaurants in a certain city in 2017. Among all the five categories, the percentages of feature, service and environment are the highest, accounting for 36.3%, 26.8% and 23.8% respectively. On the contrary, the statistics of price and other factors take up merely 8l.4% and 4.7% respectively, the lowest among the five groups. 

Several primary causes that contribute to the above-mentioned phenomenon could be summarized as follows. In the first place, with the prosperity of economy in China and the increase of people's income in recent decades, a large number of people are paying more attention to the features of a restaurant instead of prices. In the second place, in a bid to develop interpersonal relationship and enjoy comfortable life, consumers in mounting numbers prefer service and environment to other factors. 

With due consideration of all these contributors, we may predict that with the speedy development of our society, customers in expanding numbers will attach utmost significance to the feature, service as well as environment of a restaurant rather than prices or other factors. 





### 五、2019（二）

According to the above bar chart, the percentages of graduates' whereabouts in a certain university underwent an enormous change form 2013 to 2018. During this period, the number of students seeking employment has declined sharply from 68.1% to 60.7%, whereas those choosing further education and running their own business increased markedly from 26.3% and 1.3% and 2.6% respectively. 

From my perspective, the tendency in the bar chart above can be traced back to three major contributors. First and foremost, with social competition becoming keener, the situation of the job market is increasingly grim. In addition, in today's world, where the college population grows rapidly, further education becomes essential if they wish to compete for a rewarding job. Last but not least, for those with a manageable schedule, exploratory frame of mind and entrepreneurial spirit, starting their own business can offer important career benefits-not to mention a handsome paycheck. 

Generally speaking, when it comes time for university graduates to decide their next step in life, there is no right or wrong choice for everyone. Rather, each student must reach his or her own conclusion. By taking career goals, financial status and personal preferences into consideration, students can improve their chances of making an optimal choice. 





### 六、教育文化类：大学扩招

The diagram above clearly illustrates that a dramatic increase has occurred in the recruitment of Masters of Engineering (ME) in China during the past seven years. According to the statistics given above, we may conclude that the recruitment of MEs was on a steady rise from 1998 to 2004. In 1998, the number was at a low of only about 2,500. Surprisingly, it reached more than 35, 000 in 2004, within no more than seven years. 

Some driving factors that contribute to the above-mentioned change may be summarized as follows. First and foremost, China has become particularly active in manufacturing, which has led to an increased demand for qualified engineers. In addition, the development of the job market on the whole cannot keep pace with the expansion of college graduates, which has obliged a large number of students to stay on campus for another three years to get better prepared for their careers. Last but not least, working pressure is another reason. Taking all these factors into account, we may predict that with the speedy development of our society, the recruitment of MEs will keep growing in the forthcoming decade. 

On the other side of the coin, however, this tendency may bring about a good many problems, such as the waste of talent. It is necessary for us to take effective measures to ensure this situation doesn't get out of hand, and encourage students to choose majors for which both theoretical knowledge and practical skills will be demanded in the job market. 





### 七、教育文化类：读书

The column chart above reveals clearly the statistics of reading quantity per person in seven countries in 2013. Based upon the data, the reading volumes in the U.S., Israel and Russia are highest among the seven nations, accounting for 56, 44 and 42 books per person respectively. On the contrary, those in Korea and China are lowest, taking up merely 11 and 4 books. 

This tendency is rather disturbing, for reading extensively is no less necessary to one's mental life than fresh air is to one's physical life. From reading extensively, we can derive companionship, experience and instruction. First and foremost, a good book is our faithful friend. It can increase our contentment when we are cheerful and happy, and lessen our pain when we are sad or lonely. Furthermore, reading extensively can can also offer us a wide range of experiences. Few of us can travel far from home or live long over one hundred, but all of us can live many different lives through the pages of books. Last but not least, reading extensively can increase our intellectual ability, broaden our minds and make us wise. 

Though with the advent of TV, cellphone and the Internet, books are no longer read as extensively as they once were, nothing can replace the role that reading extensively plays in our lives. 



### 八、社会热点类：健康

The line chart above illustrates clearly the amount of gymnasiums and people doing exercises in a certain city between 2014 and 2016. As is revealed in the graph, the statistics of people doing exercises has been on a steady rise, from one million to nearly two million, while the number of gyms has increased considerably from 600 to about 860, a rise of about 260. 

Several factors could contribute to this tendency. In the first place, with the quickening pace and ever-increasing pressure of urban life, people in growing numbers are suffering either physical or mental problems. Thus, gymnasiums in mounting numbers have been built by concerned departments. In the second place, the desire for health is universal. Accordingly, people variously choose jogging, playing basketball, swimming, skating, climbing or riding as their regular exercise because exercise never fails to make them stronger and more energetic. 

As far as I am concerned, I have a peculiar interest in yoga as a form of exercise. An hour's exercise every day usually makes me feel healthier and more vigorous. Besides, I never touch cigarettes or wine, nor do I stay up late. Instead, I keep a balanced diet and go to bed before 11o'clock at night, because I believe burning the midnight oil is harmful to health. More importantly, an optimistic attitude toward life makes me confident and persistent. To sum up, all these practices guarantee a healthy body and a happy life. 



### 九、环境保护类：保护野生动物

Currently, there is widespread concern regarding the previously neglected connection between growing human populations and decreasing wild species. As the two graphs clearly portray, the American population in 1980 was 250 times than that of 1800, a trend accompanied by the extinction of nearly 70 kinds of wildlife in the past 300 years. A clear correlation is suggested: that mankind has exerted a tremendously negative influence on natural resources. 

There are a great many causes responsible for the aforementioned correlation. To begin with, to satisfy the space demands of a booming population, the only available solution for Americans was to inhabit forests and grasslands that used to be the habitats of wild animals and plants. In addition, the process of industrialization and urbanization has generated severe pollution that essentially  destroys environments and ecosystems. 

From my point of view, the death of wild species today forecasts an unpromising future for humans tomorrow. In order to eliminate species extinction, relevant laws and regulations must be established and enforced to maintain large unspoiled areas. Drastic measures should also be applied to ensure that the impact of pollution is removed. 



### 十、教育文化类：文化交流

It is apparent form the line graph that the number of Chinese art groups performing in the U.S. and American movies shown in China bot increased between 2010 and 2016. During the six years, the amount of Chinese art groups performing int the United States jumped from 200 to 460, whereas the number of American films shown in our country has been on a steady rise from 50 to about 180, a rise of about 130. 

Firstly, the fact that people from different countries are attracted to the mysterious Chinese culture indicates that to some extent a culture can be accepted, respected, appreciated and shared internationally. Secondly, a nation's unique culture can become international through worldwide economic and cultural exchanges. Since the trend of globalization has become irresistible, increasing cultural exchanges can effectively improve mutual understanding and friendship. 

It is my view that national culture should be preserved and cherished as a priceless spiritual treasure. Meanwhile, there are good reasons to advocate internationalized culture for those ideas from the other cultures, controversial or even absurd at first sight, can in the long run provide a different perspective for us to observe the world. Nevertheless, when we are confronted with a different culture, we should be sensible enough to absorb its virtues and to confronted with a different culture, we should be sensible enough to absorb its virtues and to resist its dark side. Only in this way can we promote national cultural development positively and make our world multidimensional, colorful and vigorous.
