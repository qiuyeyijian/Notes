Would you prefer living alone or living with roommates



When it comes to live alone or live with roommates, people's opinions differ. Many people believe that living alone is the best choice. For one thing, you can decorate however you want. When you live alone, you are the god of your apartment and you can  decorate the house according to your preferences. For the other thing, you have total freedom. Many people believe  the biggest benefit about living alone is that you have complete control and total freedom. You can clean your room every day if you want a neat and clean room. However,  no one will be there to tell you what should you do if you have a mess room.

As for as I am concerned, I prefer living with roommates. On one hand, I can enjoy a bigger apartment. I would be able to afford a bigger place with roommates to help me pay the rent. A large bedroom, a second bathroom, and a big kitchen is the must for my ideal house. Roommates can share a lot of costs of renting the house. On the other hand, I would not feel alone with friends around.  I prefer having a long-lasting relationship and a good roommates can easily be a lifelong friend. 

In a word, I prefer living with roommates

### Should capital punishment be a major deterrent to crime?



死刑应该成为遏制犯罪的主要手段。



First of all, China is a country ruled by law, and capital punishment is the most deterrent criminal law. Without the capital punishment, those criminals cannot be frightened. Vicious murderers must be killed to prevent them from murdering again, either in prison, or in society if they should get out. 

Second, the capital punishment can appease the families and friends of those victims. If there is no capital punishment, then people may always worry about being killed by the released criminals.



首先中国是一个法治国家，死刑是最具有威慑力的一种刑法。如果没有死刑，那些犯罪分子不可能被吓住。

其次，死刑可以安抚那些受害者的家人和朋友。如果没有死刑，那么人们可能时刻担心被那些放出来的罪犯杀害。
