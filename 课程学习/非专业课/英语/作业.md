Task 3 (video 3):

 Write a complaint letter to the manager of the restaurant and explain the problems based on the preceding situation. 
（以书面word文档形式完成，截止完成时间为本周末，到时递交至QQ群）

　I’m writing to lodge the complaint about the poor quality of an air conditioner that I purchased from Sun Appliance Company. Frankly speaking, Sun Appliance has always been my favorite. On April 4, 2007, I bought the air conditioner (serial number 12345) from one of your chain store located in Lang Fang. The machine operated well at first, but ten days later, there was a fault that bothered me, that is, the fan made so much noise that I could not sleep well at night. Worse still, the cooling system didn’t work well and the machine began to leak recently. Its poor quality ruined almost all my previous impression toward your products.
　　I strongly suggest that a repairman or a service engineer should be sent to my home without delay. I wonder if you could pinpoint the exact cause of the malfunction as soon as possible. If you can’t, I am afraid that I will request for full amount of refund or a new air conditioner. I would appreciate all your assistance in this matter. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to contact me. Look forward to your reply. Yours Sincerely, Li Ming







I'm writing to lodge the complaint about the poor service and food of your restaurant. Frankly speaking, your restaurant has always been one of my favorite. Therefore, on November 11, 2019, I recommended your restaurant to my friends when we decided to dine together. However,  I couldn't understand why out food took so long to prepare but other customers didn't. What's more, what a terrible service, your waiter ignored our request about preparing food quickly. Besides, I suspect your restaurant had used outdated food or the food had not been disinfected because my two friends with me had severe stomach-aches the following day. In addition, we still thought your food  was also overpriced even though your dining environments was better than others.

I hope there is a misunderstand in this but in fact my friends and I are disappointed and  I strongly suggest that you can give us a convincing explanation and apologize for us. Look forward to your reply.

Yours sincerely,

Xiao Ming

###  Is it necessary for university students to have part-time jobs? 

Nowadays many students prefer to have part-time job by using their spare time. So, should university students t get a part-time job or not? In my opinion, the benefits of having part-time jobs will definitely outweigh any disadvantages if they can balance the relationship between part-time and study. 

First, working part-time can teach students how to spending wisely. They will save a lot of unnecessary expenses and spend money on necessities, such as text books. What's more part-time job can develop student's sense of responsibility and practice what they learn in school.

Second, part-time job allows students to learn to manage time better. Because they have less free time than non-working students. They must make sure their part-time word does not affect their learning.

Third, part-time job allows students to have work experience in advance. They can use these experiences to find better jobs when they graduate



### Why is sleep deprivation so common among college students?

Nowadays, the college students face a major problem is lack of sleep. According to an investigation report, the college students get 5 to 6 hours of sleep every night far less than 8 hours recommended by experts. The important reasons go as follows. 

First of all, many students are overworked. Not only do they spend a lot of energy preparing for studies and exams but many of them still find time to socialize. What's more, almost all students like to review all night in the days before the exam because their usual study time is more or less used for entertainment. 

Second, many students prefer to play mobile phone before falling asleep. The students' time will be swallowed by many fun apps such as TikTok unconsciously. In addition, many students will hardly refuse their roommate or good friend's overnight game invitation. 

Third, students need to complete the academic courses arranged by the school during the day and then they can only use the evening time for entertainment. Besides, sleep requires a quiet environment. A student will hardly fall asleep if his roommates are playing games.

Finally, many students do not realize the importance of going to bed early and getting up early. They think there is no harm in staying up late when they are young.







### How to best handle the relationship between parents and children



Nowadays, many children have a bad relationship with their parents. These children often quarrel with their parents because they have different opinions in some respects. The root cause is because of the generation gap between these children and their parents. So, I want to give some suggestions about how to best

Good communication is an important way to avoid many unnecessary quarrels. The relationship between the children and their parents will be improved if the parents try to communicate with their children

Secondly, Parents should try to understand and respect the child's decision. The older the child, the more he likes to make his own decisions rather than relying on his parents

Children should also try to understand every decision of their parents. Parents must all hope that their children have a good future





### 翻译

In Chinese culture, red usually symbolizes good luck, longevity, and happiness. In the Spring Festival and other festive occasions, red can be seen everywhere. When people give cash as gifts to family members or close friends, they usually put them in red envelopes. Another reason why red is popular in China is that people associate it with the Chinese revolution and the Communist Party. However, red does not always mean good luck and happiness. Because the names of the deceased were often written in red, writing Chinese names in red ink was regarded as an offense.
