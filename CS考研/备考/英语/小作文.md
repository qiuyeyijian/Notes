## 2010 感谢+邀请

Dear Bob,

I wish to express my heartfelt thanks to you for your warm reception in the cultural exchange program. You warmly explained American customs, assisting me to get over culture shock quickly and, more importantly, have a deeper understanding of American culture. 

Additionally, I highly welcome you to China in your free time so that I can reciprocate your hospitality. I promise you a fantastic visit, through which you may gain a deep insight into Chinese culture.

My appreciation for your warm reception is beyond words. I am looking forward to hearing from you soon.

<p style = 'text-align:right'>Yours sincerely, <br>Zhang Wei






## 2011 祝贺信+建议信

Dear Li Ming,

Please accept my heartfelt congratulations on what you have been admitted to Bejing University. I know this has meant years of study and hard work on your part, and it is an achievement you can well proud of. 

However, as we all know, life in a prestigious university is perhaps not as easy as you have expected. Thus, I wish you could learn to manage life and study by yourself in the following four years, and gradually grow into an adult wholly responsible for yourself. 

All in all, although there is a lot of pressure, the time you spend on your campus will be worthwhile and enhance your whole life. 

<p style = 'text-align:right'>Yours sincerely, <br>Zhang Wei


## 2012 投诉信

Dear Sir or Madam,

A week ago, I bought an electronic dictionary from your online store. However, to my dismay, it doesn't work properly now.

For one thing, the ON/OFF button is not flexible, so I have to press it with more stress than needed. For another, the device becomes so hot after running for half an hour that I have to shut it down in case it burns itself. As you know, but for the reputation of your store, I could have bought one from the local mall.

For my part, your prompt attention to this matter will be appreciated or I will demand a full refund. Please reply to me as soon as possible.

<p style = 'text-align:right'>Yours sincerely, <br>Zhang Wei
